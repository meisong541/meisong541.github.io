I am a Ph. D. student major in applied mathematics and statistics at Stanford. My research is motivated by <b>data science</b>, and lies at the intersection of <b>statistics</b>, <b>machine learning</b>, <b>information theory</b>, and <b>computer science</b>. I often build on insights that originated within the <b>statistical physics</b> literature. Here is my <a href = "https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~songmei/" > Homepage</a>.

In my first several blogs, I will discuss about methods from statistical physics and random matrix theory. Hope you will have fun here!
