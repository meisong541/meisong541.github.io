I am a Ph. D. student major in applied mathematics and statistics at Stanford. My research interests lie in the intersection of statistics, machine learning, information theory, and computer science. I often build on insights that originated within the statistical physics literature. Here is my <a href = "https://web.stanford.edu/~songmei" > Homepage</a>.

In my first several blogs, I will discuss about methods from statistical physics and random matrix theory. Hope you will have fun here!
